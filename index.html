              A good horror film should meet the bar on all its dimensions. This is because horror is a few steps away
              from becoming anything else. Imagine if the culminating bloodbath in 28 Weeks
              Later (2007) was overlaid with "Entry of the Gladiators" by Fucik (Jordan Peele says the
              difference between comedy and horror is music). Fear is a manifold yet sensitive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sinister nailed the music, especially in the background of its murder scenes, which apparently were
              taken from tracks associated with Norwegian death metal. This is a fitting parallel as
              controversy surrounding Norwegian death metal include church burnings and murders. As an aside,
              I can
              appreciate edge but it's hard to take seriously after a certain degree. Don't these guys crave McDonald's
              sometimes? How hard can you really be? In any case, the music was unpredictable, indiscernible, and eerie
              which nailed the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              That being said, the movie did not capitalize on said atmosphere. Tension serves as a buildup towards a
              break
              and a good horror film finds this rhythm with proper cadence. The tension breaks in Sinister can be
              summarized
              as cheap jump scares and a gradual reveal of the demon which was hard to take seriously. "Gabagool" looks
              like Gene Simmons who let himself go. When the shoe finally dropped, they were beat up Crocs (no shame,
              just a metaphor for something innocuous). I was
              neither convinced by the daughter nor economy-class Kiss. All would have been forgiven if the coda was
              solid but the final jump scare ruined it. Nonetheless, a fun watch with friends.

              Nowadays, trailers seem to give a lot away with this movie being no exception, or so I thought. There's
              always a twist
              with
              Shyamalan so obviously it couldn't have revealed everything! I suppose the twist might have been no
              twist at all, which I'm always keeping in the back of my mind; one of these days, Manoj will throw a
              curveball, except there is no ball.
            </p>
            <p>
              Josh Hartnett is clearly the killer and we know who the victim is. "Pack it up guys, we can go home
              early!" But
              the grip of the plot is how Josh evades the police with clever tactics. The <i>how</i> of it all, that is
              how the manhunt started, is also a nice little reveal. The pacing felt nice with gradual, well spaced
              tensions: the boxcutter scene with Jamie, Lady Raven stealing Josh's phone, to Josh somehow escaping the
              limousine (which was baloney but I can be thrown a curveball, right Manoj?).
            </p>
            <p>
              Character decisions seemed to be spot on. When Josh reveals his identity to Lady Raven in her
              dressing room, I personally would cooperate and yell for security as soon as we walk out. This
              does kill Spencer, but the reasoning being kill one to save many? This might just be shortsightedness on
              my part because the sequence of events leading to Raven's clever rescue doesn't seem farfetched at all.
              Josh's wife, long lost descendant of Hercule Poirot, is a genius. The standoff between her and Josh made
              me think of possible non-invasive ways a surveillance team might be alerted of an intruder: a heartbeat
              monitor with abnormal rates triggering a check in, microphones but only triggered on certain "words"
              (cough Alexa), or just an old-fashioned button.
            </p>

              Overall,
              enjoyable morsel from MNS. To state the obvious, it wasn't an "opus backed by unlimited budget"
              by
              design
              as the characters and setting are limited and nicely contained (literally). These are the sort of flicks
              that tug at my moviestrings, probably because you're forced to dive than wade on the surface. Thumbs up!
