            Queenpins was something I enjoyed while folding laundry. Kristen Bell is very good at
            playing a spunky yet cynical rule-breaker, which may be a take biased from her role in The Good Place (2016
            - 2020). I was surprised to see Paul Rust who I only know from Love (2016
            - 2018), which I've seen around 7 times, as well as Vince Vaughn and Joel McHale.

              The coupon scam is simple but strategic and plausible enough for plot. The humor relied on poking fun at a
              down-in-luck, overweight loss prevention worker which was sad to see at a writing and movie
              level. Kristen Bell and Kirby Howell-Baptiste fumbling through their new life of crime was cute and
              enjoyable. The jokes and dialogue weren't great but not expected to be.
            </p>

              I'm not surprised this movie flopped the box office as I probably wouldn't pay to watch this in
              theatres. The movie served its purpose as ambient, low-brow fun similar to a Melissa McCarthy film. No
              shame as these
              flicks are probably churned as such by design. You wouldn't go to a restaurant to try a
              cookie; you're glad to eat cookie at home while checking your email.

              A good horror film should meet the bar on all its dimensions because horror is a few steps away
              from anything else. Fear is a manifold yet sensitive experience. Sinister nails the music but little else.
            </p>

              The background music of the murder scenes were apparently
              taken from Norwegian death metal. The music was unpredictable and indiscernible which built an
              atmosphere that was not capitalized. Atmosphere creates tension to serve as a buildup towards a
              break
              and a good horror film finds this rhythm with proper cadence. The breaks in Sinister were jump
              scares and a demon that was hard to take seriously. "Gabagool" looks
              like Gene Simmons and when the shoe finally dropped, I was
              unconvinced by the daughter. Nonetheless, a fun watch with friends (who gave great commentary).

              Nowadays, trailers seem to give a lot away with this movie being no exception, or so I thought. There's
              always a twist
              with
              Shyamalan so obviously it couldn't have revealed everything! I suppose the twist might have been no
              twist at all, which I'm always keeping in the back of my mind; one of these days, Manoj will throw a
              curveball, except there is no ball.
            </p>

              Josh Hartnett is clearly the killer and we know who the victim is. "Pack it up guys, we can go home
              early!" But
              the grip of the plot is how Josh evades the police with clever tactics. The <i>how</i> of it all, that is
              how the manhunt started, is also a nice little reveal. The pacing felt nice with gradual, well spaced
              tensions: the boxcutter scene with Jamie, Lady Raven stealing Josh's phone, to Josh somehow escaping the
              limousine (which was baloney but I can be thrown a curveball, right Manoj?).
            </p>
            <p>
              Character decisions seemed to be spot on. When Josh reveals his identity to Lady Raven in her
              dressing room, I personally would cooperate and yell for security as soon as we walk out. This
              does kill Spencer, but the reasoning being kill one to save many? This might just be shortsightedness on
              my part because the sequence of events leading to Raven's clever rescue doesn't seem farfetched at all.
              Josh's wife, long lost descendant of Hercule Poirot, is a genius. The standoff between her and Josh made
              me think of possible non-invasive ways a surveillance team might be alerted of an intruder: a heartbeat
              monitor with abnormal rates triggering a check in, microphones but only triggered on certain "words"
              (cough Alexa), or just an old-fashioned button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall,
              enjoyable morsel from MNS. To state the obvious, it wasn't an "opus backed by unlimited budget"
              by
              design
              as the characters and setting are limited and nicely contained (literally). These are the sort of flicks
              that tug at my moviestrings, probably because you're forced to dive than wade on the surface. Thumbs up!
